                    The philosophy of <span style="color: #5f82a9;">Stoicism</span>
                </h2>
        </div>      
                
        <p>"Stoicism" was a philosophy many heard of due to Marcus Aurelius, a roman emperor
            and potentially one of the most powerful men to have ever lived. It's a philosophy that flourished 
            about 400 years ago in Ancient Greece and Rome, gaining support among all classes of society.
        </p>
        <p>The main, highly overwhelming ambition: Teach people how to be calm and brave in the face of overwhelming anxiety and pain.</p>

        
        <p>Stoicism has been a common thread though some of history's great leaders. It has been practiced by Kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs. Marcus Aurelius. Frederick the Great, 
            Montaigne, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Theodore Roosevelt, General James Mattis,
             —just to name a few—were all influenced by Stoic philosophy. </p>

             <p>To the average person, this vibrant, action-oriented, and paradigm-shifting way of living has become shorthand for “emotionlessness.” Given the fact that the mere mention of philosophy makes most nervous or bored, 
                “Stoic philosophy” on the surface sounds like the last thing anyone would want to learn about, let alone urgently need in the course of daily life. </p>

        <p>In todays age Stoicism is also often criticised for teaching you men "toxic masculinity" when that couldn't be further from the truth.  </p>
        <p>In its core, Stoicism is a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance and wisdom, rather than some field of academic inquiry. <em>It's a way of life.</em>
             Stoicism is used to tackle difficult tasks heads on without wavering when your emotions attempt to lead you down a wrong path. 
            
        </p>


        <p>It is truly terrifying, when it's normalised and preached by society that you should act upon emotion and tackle something with logic and without reason.<br></p>
            
            <div class="quote_bar">
                <div class="container">
                    <p><strong>Principle 1:</strong><br>
                        <em> In order to get disciplined, don't act off your feelings.</em></p>
                </div>
        </div>
        

        <p>Stoics teach that we must learn to seperate what we can control from what we cannot. 
                We need to determine our value not from things we can't control, but from the things we can.
                Striving towards goals is a good trait, but breaking down when those things don't go your way
                is in a Stoics point of view, useless. </p>


            <p>With far more distractions than ever, standing between you and your goal, you will often stumble across obstacles. Maybe you have to work overtime at work, get more homework than expected
                or have to finish a project, because one teammember didn't do his assigned work. This happens, but these are incidents you can merely control.</p>
                 

                <p>Which mindset will you adopt? Achieve your goals with sheer determination and discipline. Nobody likes to do these tasks voluntarily, but the Stoic doesn't complain. He works with precision and determination to dedicate his 
                efforts to his original goal and his core-principles.</p>
    
            <h3>What are the core-principles of Stoic-philosophy?</h3>
            <ul class="advice_list">
                <li>Be brave</li>
                <li>Do what's right</li>
                <li>Seek truth and understanding</li>
                <li>Seek moderation and sobriety</li>
                <li>Seek wisdom</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With sacrifices, determination and hard focused work comes tranquility of mind.
                Get uncomfortable today to lead a better life tomorrow. To achieve enduring happiness and 
                tranquility of mind, you must become a <em>virtuous person.</em><br>
                Therefore, positive behavior leads toward a more positive life experience, whereas negative behavior results
                in a more challenging one. </p>
            
            <p>In summation, Stoicism is a philosophy that teaches a particular way of living, with the primary focus of living a virtuous life, 
                reduce negative emotions and maximise happiness. </p>
            <p>Many like to view Stoicism as a way of constant self-improvement, to become an immovable object in the face of suffering and self-doubt.
                 Whether you share the philosophy
                or not, its core principle: <br>
                <em>To become a better and self-aware human-being</em> is a concept everyone of us should wholheartedly adopt. Not only for themselves but in order
                to set an example for future generations to show what kind of person they should become. In a time where the human species is divided more than ever, we can only depend on each others 
                open-mindedness and our desire to advance and amend.
